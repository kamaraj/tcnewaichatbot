This could potentially be for large pony hunters, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\nCOVERAGE:\n\n- In IHSA, recognized competitions include those sanctioned by USEF, USHJA, USEA, or USDF (Section 8101, Page 71).\n- Any number of mounted lessons taken within a week constitutes a week of instruction (Section 8101, Page 71).\n- Hunter seat equitation classes are judged on hunter seat equitation specifically and must have a minimum of three competitors to count as a win (Section 8101, Page 71).\n- Equitation classes on the flat must require the rider to canter in order to count as a win (Section 8101, Page 71).\n- Riders who are entering IHSA with only International experience will need to follow the corresponding fence heights and ribbons won from competitions that are recognized/sanctioned by that country\u2019s governing body (Section 8101, Page 71).\n- An Academic Year is any two consecutive semesters (Section 8101, Page 71).\n- The performance begins when the horse enters the ring or is given the signal to proceed after entering the ring. Except for refusals, jumping faults of the horse are not to be considered unless it is the fault of the rider (Section 6206, Page 48).\n- Number of strides shall not be considered unless it is the fault of the rider (Section 6206, Page 48).\n- Each contestant may circle once, if desired, before approaching the first jump. They shall then proceed around the course, keeping an even pace throughout (Section 6206, Page 48).\n- Three cumulative refusals will eliminate (Section 6206, Page 48).\n- If a refusal occurs in a double or triple, riders shall re-jump all elements of the combination. No courtesy fence will be allowed after elimination (Section 6206, Page 48).\n- If no actual height is listed on the report, the maximum allowable height will be recognized for placement purposes (Section 8101, Page 72).\n- Riders may continue to compete in their divisions until their eligibility is up, even if they have qualified out of the corresponding Hunter Seat or Western division (Section 8103, Page 73).\n- Open riders on the flat and over fences are those who have competed in an NCEA Recognized competition (Section 8102, Page 72).\n- Limit Hunter Seat Equitation over Fences riders may not show below Limit Hunter Seat Equitation on the Flat (Section 8102, Page 73).\n- Riders who canter/lope in one IHSA discipline may not start in the Introductory or Beginner division in the other discipline (Section 8102, Page 73).\n- Riders are eligible for IHSA Class 2A or 12A or above if they have earned 36 points in Class 1 or are new riders (Section 8102, Page 74).\n- Riders are eligible until 18 points are accumulated in Class 2A.

    "actual": " I cannot find specific rules regarding standing martingales in the hunter divisions within the provided documents.

These sections imply that the rules governing a class should be followed, but there is no explicit mention of standing martingales.\n\n- Care and control of horses including any drugs or medications administered shall be the sole prerogative of the horse provider or their designated representative (Section 4302, Page 31). This suggests that equipment like a martingale could potentially fall under this category, but again, there is no specific mention of standing martingales.\n\n- Special classes may be offered by the show committee if time and horse availability permit; but they must be scheduled after the regular over fences classes are completed (Section 4307, Page 32). This might indicate that any equipment rules for special classes could differ from those in the hunter divisions.\n\n- Affiliated Associations consist of organizations and other groups in good standing...which have federated together to form an association (Section 1701, Page 11). This suggests that different affiliated associations might have their own rules regarding equipment like martingales.\n\n[Note: Additional relevant sections were found in evidence but might have been summarized above.]",

All previous points are carried over within the Class from the \nbeginner to advanced sections, and when riders accumulate a total of 36 points, \nthey must move up to the next Class.  Riders are also qualified for Regionals once \nthey have earned the 36 points between the beginner and advanced sections. \n(Section 7201, page 62)\n\nRiders in classes 3 - 6 & 11-15must move into the next higher class when they \nhave earned 36 points.  They are also qualified for Regionals.\n(Section 7203, page 62)\n\nRiders must move out of classes 1 & 11 when their years of eligibility expire, \nregardless of points earned.  They must move into the next higher class when they \nhave earned 36 points and they are also qualified for Regionals.\n(Section 7204, page 62)\n\nRiders in Classes 7, 8, 16 & 17 will start each year with zero points and must \nacquire 28 to qualify for Regionals.

    "actual": " DIRECT: To qualify for hunt seat regionals, a rider needs to acquire 28 points in Classes 7, 8, 16, or 17 as stated in Section 7207 (Page 62) and Section 7401 (Page 64). If no rider qualifies due to differences in the number of shows held within a region, the minimum points required may be lowered with permission from the National Steward. The exact wording is:\n- Riders in Classes 7, 8, 16 & 17 will start each year with zero points and must acquire 28 to qualify for Regionals. (Section 7207, Page 62)\n- Riders are eligible to compete in the Regional Show upon acquiring 28/36 points in a class. See Rule 7207.
